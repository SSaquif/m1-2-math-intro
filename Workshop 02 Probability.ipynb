    "In order to make the circle centred at (0,0), I set start and end points of my axis to the __axisStart__ and __axisEnd__ value in my code below. <br/> <br/>I also add an additional 0.0001 length to this point. I did this because after reading up on **random.uniform(start,end)** function, the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.uniform) seems to say it includes start but excludes end, ie [start,end) . However, end can be included<br/>\n",
    "Upon furthur [reading](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58241868/can-random-uniform0-1-ever-generate-0-or-1), people seemed to suggest that even start is theoretically very rare/not possible since there are infintely many points in the interval<br/>\n",
    "So my questions are:\n",
    "1. Can the start and end values actually be generated through random.uniform(start,end)\n",
    "2. If not, is it ok to ignore it because it falls within an acceptable error margin especially if number of trials is large?\n",
    "3. Otherwise, is there a better function to use? Or a better way to use this function?\n"
